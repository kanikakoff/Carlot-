# CarLot

## Overview

The CarLot project is designed to manage car requests and inventory using a queue-based system. This project involves creating and managing queues to handle car requests efficiently, ensuring that cars are returned in the order they were requested and from the appropriate queue. 

## Features

- **Queue Management**: Implements functionality to enqueue and dequeue cars.
- **Request Processing**: Handles car requests and processes them based on availability.
- **Type Handling**: Demonstrates how different queues can store various types of cars.
- **Order Preservation**: Ensures cars are returned in the order they were requested.

## Skills Utilized

1. **Programming Languages**:
   - **Java**: Used for implementing core functionalities, including queue operations and request processing.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - **Queues**: Implemented to manage car requests and inventory efficiently.
   - **Linked Lists**: Used to manage the queue elements.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - **Class Design**: Developed classes such as `Car`, `Queue`, and `CarLot` to represent entities and manage their interactions.
   - **Encapsulation**: Applied encapsulation principles to ensure data integrity and modular design.

4. **Algorithm Design**:
   - **Enqueue and Dequeue Operations**: Implemented algorithms to add and remove cars from queues.
   - **Order Preservation**: Ensured that car requests are processed in the order they were received.

5. **Testing**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Conducted tests to verify the correctness of queue operations and request processing.
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensured that the system components work together as expected.

6. **System Design**:
   - **Architecture**: Designed the system to handle multiple queues and process requests efficiently.
   - **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to manage invalid operations and edge cases.

7. **Documentation**:
   - **README Writing**: Created comprehensive documentation to explain the projectâ€™s functionality, usage, and technical details.
